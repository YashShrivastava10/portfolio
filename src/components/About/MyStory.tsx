          I&apos;ll be honest â€” I had zero exposure to coding before college.
          The first time I heard the word &ldquo;coding&ldquo; was during my
          freshman year, and let me tell you, it was intimidating! ðŸ˜…

        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Those early days were rough. I struggled with basic concepts, spent
          countless hours debugging simple programs, and questioned if I was cut
          out for this. But something kept me going â€” maybe it was the
          satisfaction of finally getting that code to work, or the realization
          that I was building something from nothing.

          Fast forward ~4 years, and here I am! What started as curiosity about
          frontend development has evolved into a full-stack journey. I&apos;ve
          explored backend development, databases, cloud technologies, and even
          DevOps. Each new technology feels like unlocking a new superpower, and
          I love how the pieces of the puzzle keep fitting together to create
          something bigger! ðŸš€
